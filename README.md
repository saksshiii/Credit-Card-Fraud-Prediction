# Credit-Card-Fraud-Prediction

# Conclusion
We investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features and understanding the relationship between different features.

We used both train-validation split and cross-validation to evaluate the model effectiveness to predict the target value, i.e. detecting if a credit card holder will default payment or not in next month.

We then investigated five predictive models: We started with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Random Forests algorithms.

The Accuracy of Random Forests model(81.39%) is more as compare to other models.

This would also inform the issuerâ€™s decisions on who to give a credit card to and what credit limit to provide!
