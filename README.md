# Credit-Card-Fraud-Prediction
The model we built here will use all possible factors to predict data on customers to find who are defaulters and non-defaulters next month.

The goal is to find the whether the clients are able to pay their next month credit amount.

Identify some potential customers for the bank who can settle their credit balance.

To determine if their customers could make the credit card payments on-time. 

Default is the failure to pay interest or principal on a loan or credit card payment!


# Conclusion
We investigated the data, checking for data unbalancing, visualizing the features and understanding the relationship between different features.

We used both train-validation split and cross-validation to evaluate the model effectiveness to predict the target value, i.e. detecting if a credit card holder will default payment or not in next month.

We then investigated five predictive models: We started with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Random Forests algorithms.

The Accuracy of Random Forests model(81.39%) is more as compare to other models.

This would also inform the issuer’s decisions on who to give a credit card to and what credit limit to provide!
